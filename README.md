# DjangoKeras

With this project I am trying to learn more about Django itself and Keras deep learning models. For deep learning part, I have created a simple binary classification model with Pima Indians diabetes data. Data itself is public and widely used and this particular set is from Kaggle and contains these features:

*Pregnancies     Number of times pregnant
*Glucose         Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure   Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness   Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin         2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI             Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction
Age is years
Outcome (1 or 0, True or False)
